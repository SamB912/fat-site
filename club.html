    First and Third Trinity Boat Club is the boat club of Trinity College in Cambridge, UK. Trinity is the largest
    of the Cambridge University Colleges. The club typically teaches between 60 and 80 people to learn to row each 
    year. We cater for everyone - boats will train anywhere from twice to 12 times a week. We have up to 14 boats
    rowing in the Cambridge May Bumps - the highlight of the College rowing calendar.

    Rowing at Trinity started with the formation of First Trinity Boat Club in 1825. Second and Third Trinity were 
    formed shortly after this. All three clubs enjoyed a lot of success during the 19th century. The dissolution of 
    Second Trinity did nothing to dim the college's success. The Clubs were a formidable force, sending crews to the 
    Olympics, and winning the Grand at Henley several times.

    In the early 20th century, First Trinity BC and Third Trinity BC remained separate entities. The latter was only
    open to students coming up from Eton or Westminster.  The college rowing scene flourished, and many college boat 
    clubs grew in membership. At the same time, Third Trinity suffered from a decreasing number appropriate students.
    To remain competitive with these larger clubs, the two Trinity clubs merged in 1947. The new club, First and 
    Third Trinity Boat Club, is still one of the largest and most successful on the Cam.
